# Bitcoin UI Kit Penpot API test

This is a test project for seeing how we can use the [Penpot API](https://design.penpot.app/api/_doc?type=js) to complement our
workflows in the tool. For example:

- Automated web-based design docs
- Previewing and evaluating components
- Customizing the theme before duplicating and importing for new projects
- Export of specific assets

What is exactly possible needs to be explored further. Hence, this test project.
